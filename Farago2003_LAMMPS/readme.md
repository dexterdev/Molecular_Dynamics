This folder is a LAMMPS implementation of https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0304203 (Farago,2003 - Water-free coarse grained lipid membrane system)

To create the custom potential energy and force tables use the matlab script in this folder.
Then with the aid of moltemplate and lammps scripting we generate system.data intitial structure and script files necessary to run the simulation.
Customize it for minimization and simulations.
